Description: The package takes in a matrix that contains a value (e.g., mortality rate) 
  arranged by age as rows and calendar year as columns and creates a visualization of 
  the data as a hexamap. For more information on hexmaps, please refer to this paper

  and implementation in R." Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.) 31.6 (2020): e47.
